Designed a rule-based fuzzy logic model using skfuzzy in python to do water quality analysis using drinking water parameters as per BIS standards. Real groundwater data of India was used to implement fuzzy membership functions and rule evaluation for uncertainty modeling, categorizing and ranking regions based on WQI. Performed data preprocessing and feature engineering with pandas and numPy, and built visual analytics dashboards with matplotlib and seaborn to interpret results.
